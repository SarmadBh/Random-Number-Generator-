# Random-Number-Generator.
The "Guess the Number" game generates a random number between 1 and 10.
Users input their guesses through a web interface.
The JavaScript code, organized within a Game ðŸŽ® object, checks the validity of the input, updates the number of attempts, and compares the guess to the randomly generated number.
If the guess is correct, a congratulatory message is displayed. Otherwise, the user is informed of the incorrect guess along with a list of their previous attempts.
The project incorporates HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, utilizing concepts like objects, arrays, and event handling.
